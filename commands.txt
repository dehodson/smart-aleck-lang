List of smart-aleck commands:

a - push the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to the stack (lowercase letters)
b -
c -
d -
e -
f - print the first 10 fibonacci numbers
g -
h -
i - read an integer from stdin
j -
k -
l - pop an int, push a list containing numbers from 0 to that int
m -
n - pop item n from the last of the stack and push back on
o - print top item of stack without popping
p -
q -
r - pop from the stack, convert to roman numeral and push back on
s -
t -
u -
v -
w -
x - reverse the stack
y -
z - push the string '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to the stack (alphanumerics)

A - push the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ' (uppercase letters)
B - 99 bottles of beer program will be printed
C - 
D -
E -
F - FizzBuzz will be printed
G -
H - push the string 'Hello, world!'
I - read all ints from stdin, push a list containing them to the stack
J -
K -
L - loop unless stack is empty
M -
N - pop item n from the start of the stack and push back on
O -
P - pop from stack and print
Q - print the program (any program with only one Q is a Quine)
R - pop and reverse string or list, then push back on. If stack is empty, reverse stdin and append
S - push stdin to the stack
T - loop if stack is not empty and the top value is truthy
U -

W -
X - 
Y -
Z - push the string 'ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to the stack (upper and lowercase letters)

+ - pop a and b, add them and push back (will concatenate strings)
- - pop a and b, subtract b from a and push back (if performed on strings, will remove all characters from b from a)
* - pop a and b, multiply and push back (will repeat strings if multiplied)

# - if present, all code not between sets of # will be ignored
$ - pop and discard
% - pop a, b, push a mod b
: - pop a, push a and a (duplicate top of stack)
= - push (top of stack == 2nd from top), if there is only one item on stack compares STDIN
\ - pop a and b, push a and b (swap top two items of stack)
_ - flatten list
, - convert a to or from char code
. - concatenate all items in list, or all strings on top of the stack
@ - push " !\"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ[\\]^_`abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz{|}~" (all visible ASCII characters)
' - push the string representation of the next character
" - string
} - end conditional

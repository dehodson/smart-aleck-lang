## A golfing language with some smart aleck responses

I suppose you're tired of being asked to write FizzBuzz. By now, everyone is. SmartAleck is the solution. The next time you get asked to write FizzBuzz, simply respond with:
```
F
```
In SmartAleck, that program prints FizzBuzz!

There are other one-character programs for common programming challenges:

Hello world: `H`

99 Bottles of Beer: `B`

Quine: `Q`

Fibonacci sequence: `f`

Cat: ` ` (The cat program is an empty program)

## Cool, but what else?

SmartAleck is also a fully-featured code golfing language.

## WIP

SmartAleck is a work in progress. If you've stumbled upon this page, feel free to try it out and contribute. But know that some commands may change over time.
